# Project Updates Summary

## Component Flow Analysis & Improvements

### Instagram Implementation

We've analyzed the Instagram feed implementation and made several improvements:

1. **Renamed component for clarity**:
   - Renamed `ElfsightInstagramFeed` to `InstagramFeedSection` to better reflect functionality
   - The component uses our custom Instagram embed implementation, not Elfsight
   - Updated all imports and references in homepage

2. **Component flow analysis**:
   - Created detailed documentation in `/docs/project-structure-analysis.md`
   - Identified the component relationships and dependencies
   - Verified that components flow together properly

3. **Testing tools**:
   - Created a component flow test script (`/scripts/test-component-flow.js`)
   - This script analyzes component relationships, imports, and usage
   - It verifies that all components are properly connected

### Push Notification System

Our analysis confirmed the updated push notification system is working properly:

1. **Platform-specific handling**:
   - Proper detection of iOS vs Android devices
   - Custom icons based on platform in `/public/only_these/` directory
   - Platform-tailored welcome messages

2. **Deduplication enhancements**:
   - Using IndexedDB for better persistence
   - Content hash generation prevents duplicate notifications
   - Proper token refresh mechanism

3. **Service worker integration**:
   - Correct service worker version (3.0.0)
   - Auto configuration with Firebase
   - Proper background handling

### Reservation System

The reservation system has been successfully implemented:

1. **Three booking types**:
   - Table reservations
   - Catering requests
   - Birthday/event bookings

2. **Contact information**:
   - Phone: (503) 391-9123
   - Email: info@sidehustlebar.com
   - Direct links for easy contact

3. **Animations**:
   - Smooth transitions between form types using Framer Motion
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Homepage Flow

The homepage now has a clear, logical flow of components:

1. Header section with location switcher
2. Main promotional content
3. App installation prompts
4. Map and directions (location-specific)
5. Instagram feed section
6. Reservation section
7. Google reviews section

This creates a natural progression from brand introduction to social proof and action items.

## Next Steps

1. **Continue component consolidation**:
   - Choose between custom Instagram embed vs. Elfsight approach
   - Remove any unused Elfsight-related components
   - Further standardize component naming

2. **Complete PWA enhancements**:
   - Ensure seamless offline experience
   - Add app-like navigation
   - Fine-tune iOS installation flow

3. **Testing**:
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile device testing
   - Performance optimization
