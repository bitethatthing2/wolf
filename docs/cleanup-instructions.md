# Instagram Component Cleanup

## Summary of Changes

We've identified several unused or redundant components related to Instagram embedding. This document details the changes made and explains the simplified component structure.

## Components Removed

The following components have been removed from the codebase:

1. `ElfsightInstagramFeed.tsx` - Replaced by InstagramFeedSection
2. `SideHustleInstagramFeed.tsx` - Not actively used
3. `SmartElfsightWidget.tsx` - No active usages
4. `ElfsightWidget.tsx` - Only used by removed components
5. `ElfsightMock.tsx` - Only used in development for removed components

## Updated Component Structure

### Current Implementation

The codebase now uses a simplified approach:

```
Homepage/Locations Page
        │
        ▼
InstagramFeedSection
        │
        ▼
  InstagramEmbed
```

- `InstagramFeedSection` is the main component used on the homepage and locations page
- `InstagramEmbed` is the core implementation that handles Instagram embedding

### Benefits

1. **Simplified Code** - Removed redundant components and consolidated the implementation
2. **Better Performance** - Direct implementation instead of multiple layers of components
3. **Clearer Dependencies** - Simplified dependency tree makes maintenance easier
4. **Reduced Bundle Size** - Fewer components means smaller JS bundles

## Package Changes

We've removed the dependency on the Elfsight widget library since we're using our own custom Instagram embedding implementation:

- Removed `next-elfsight-widget` from package.json

## How to Test

1. Ensure the Instagram feed displays correctly on:
   - Homepage (`/`)
   - Locations page (`/locations`)

2. Verify the feed works in:
   - Light mode
   - Dark mode
   - Mobile view
   - Desktop view

## Backup Information

Before deletion, all files were backed up to:
```
backups/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

## Additional Notes

The cleanup was performed by using the script:
```
scripts/cleanup-unused-components.sh
```

If there are any issues, the original files can be restored from the backup directory.
