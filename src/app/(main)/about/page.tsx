              <p className="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Side Hustle Bar opened its doors in early 2022 in downtown Salem, Oregon, in the former Brown's Towne space on Liberty Street. Founded by James Mullins and with Chef Rebeckah Sanchez overseeing the food and drink operations, Side Hustle quickly established itself as a premier destination for great food, drinks, and entertainment.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600 mb-4">
                What makes Side Hustle truly special is the eclectic atmosphere created by its founders. Despite not having previous bar experience, James and Becky brought their unique vision to life, combining James' business acumen from years in auto dealership management with Becky's culinary expertise to create something truly unique in Salem's downtown scene.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600">
                After tremendous success in Salem, Side Hustle expanded to Portland in 2025, bringing its signature high-energy environment, exceptional Mexican cuisine, and vibrant nightlife to a second location. Today, Side Hustle Bar continues to be a beloved establishment in both cities, known for its sleek interior, amazing food, and unforgettable events.
