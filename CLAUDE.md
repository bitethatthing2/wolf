# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, Lint, and Test Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production and prepare for Netlify
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Imports**: Group imports by type (React, external libs, internal components, types)
- **Components**: Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing; avoid `any` type; define shared types in `src/types`
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components; camelCase for functions/variables; kebab-case for files
- **CSS**: Use Tailwind with `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- **Context**: Create context providers with custom hooks (see `useLocation`)
- **Error Handling**: Use error boundaries and explicit error states in components
- **State Management**: Use React Context for global state; local state for component-specific logic
- **Icons**: Use Lucide React for icons; custom icons in `src/components/icons`
- **Theme**: Support both light and dark modes with `next-themes`

## Next.js Best Practices
- **Image Component**: Use the modern Next.js Image component with `fill` prop instead of the legacy `layout="fill"` and `objectFit` props
- **Navigation Error Handling**: The app includes custom error handling for Next.js navigation errors with retry logic
- **Polyfills**: Custom polyfills are available in `src/polyfills/index.js` and are automatically included
- **Error Boundaries**: Use the enhanced ErrorBoundary component for catching React rendering errors
- **Client Components**: All client-side components should be wrapped with the ClientComponentsWrapper

## Architecture Documentation
You can find detailed documentation for key systems in the `/docs/` folder:

- **Push Notification System**: `/docs/learnings/notification-system.md`
- **Next.js Error Handling**: `/docs/learnings/next-error-handling.md`
- **PWA Installation Flow**: `/docs/architecture/installation-flow.md`

## Supabase Security Recommendations
- **Update Supabase URL**: The project's Supabase URL should be set to `https://dzvvjgmnlcmgrsnyfqnw.supabase.co` in environment files
- **Enable Leaked Password Protection**: This should be enabled in the Supabase dashboard under Auth settings
- **Review OTP Expiry Time**: Set OTP (One-Time Password) expiry to less than an hour for security
- **Fix Function Search Path**: The `public.update_last_active` function needs its search_path parameter set to address the mutable search path security issue
